# Configuration

The PHPDoc addon relies on the `structure.xml` file generated by PHPDoc.
There's tons of ways to include this into your workflow like git hooks or even a simple bash script you sometimes run yourself.
This is something you'll have to decide on your own. To generate the `structure.xml` file, you'd generally do something like


### 1. Generate structure.xml
It comes down to

- Generate a _structure.xml_ file with phpdoc using `--template=xml`
- Move the _structure.xml_ file to the `docs` directory
- Use the artisan command `codex:phpdoc:create` to process the _structure.xml_ file

A basic example:
```bash
cd path/to/my/project
ls
# - docs
# - app
# - tests
# - composer.json
# - etc..

phpdoc -t phpdoc -d app -d tests --template=xml
mv phpdoc/structure.xml docs/structure.xml
rm -rf phpdoc
php artisan codex:phpdoc:create
```

Once you've moved the `structure.xml` file into the documentation directory, you're good to go.




### 2. Add to project
To enable PHPDoc, you will have to configure your project:

```php
return [
    'display_name' => 'My Awesome Project',
    // ... 
    'phpdoc' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'default_class' => 'Codex\\Codex'
    ]
];
```
Note that the `default_class` uses 2 `\`. This is **intentional** and **required**.




### 3. Add to menu
By default, the PHPDoc addon uses the `phpdoc` document path. This means, you can include it into the menu in `codex.yml`. For example:

```yaml
menu:
  - name: Getting Started
    icon: fa fa-document
    children:
      - name: Overview
        document: index

      - name: API Documentation
        document: phpdoc
```
